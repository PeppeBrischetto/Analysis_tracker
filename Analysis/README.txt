Macros
-------------------
A_checkTime.C          Check that the event are ordered by total time. OBSOLETE

A_eventFinder_plot.C	find event and plot an anode map of charge and time.
			print on screen also the entry of the first pad of the event
			
A_eventFinderTrSiC_plot.C Find an event in coincidence between one Sic ans the tracker
			and plot the event on the anode.		

A_plot_EnergyVsChannel.C plot the charge vs digitizer channel in a TH2 for each digitizer

A_plot_EnergyVsPad.C	plot the charge vs pad in a TH2 for each row

A_plotMap_entries	plot the map of hit on the anode for a given number of entries

A_plotMap_time		plot the map of hit on the anode for a given interval of time

A_plot_padSpectrum.C    plot the charge spectrum of a single pad in a run splitting the
			run in more pieces.

A_plot_padSpectrum_1.C  plot the charge spectrum of multiple pad in a single plot

A_plot_padSpectrum_2.C  plot the charge spectrum of a single pad with a condition
			on the hit multiplicity in a time window

B_anglesFinder_plot_tracker_and_sic_v5.C  
			Macro that generate the tracks and associate the SiC hit with a 
			track. For check only. The generation of the track file is done 
			by trackGenerator.C

B_resolutionCalc.C	OBSOLETE


B_trackFinder_plot.C 	find the tracks and plot them. OBSOLETE

C_plot_tracks_theta.C	plot tracks from files Tracks on the horizontal plane

C_plot_tracks_Phi.C	plot tracks from files Tracks on the vertical plane

C_plot_phi.C		plot phi spectra of a single SiC. OBSOLETE

C_plot_theta.C		plot theta spectra of a single SiC. OBSOLETE

C_plot_ChargeSiC.C	plot charge spectra for the SiC

C_plot_clusterCharge	plot energy spectrum of the cluster for each raw





Z_check_mean.C		check the value of the mean of the istogram of a cluster
		and the center of gravity
